            We are Valley Tech Academy alumni's that are excited to create and complete tough challenges that push our learning experience to the limit.
        </br>We come all the way from asking ourselves "What the heck is this?" to "Whoa! I can do this!" to "I actually did it, yea I created it!"
    </br>It's really about putting all the pieces together and understanding what each code means and does and where it needs to go.
</br>If we can do this.....then anybody can Code too...no matter what level of education one has.
</br>Valley Tech Academy...is the place to be!
